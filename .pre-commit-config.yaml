        # ruff-format checks and fails if not formatted, but might auto-format by default.
        # To make it check-only, we usually generally rely on the hook failing.
        # But standard behavior of this hook IS to format.
        # If user strictly wants NO modification, we might need a custom command or 'entry: uv run ruff format --check'
        # However, for pre-commit, the widely accepted "blocker" IS to format and fail the commit so you check the formatting.
        # If the user says "instead of fixing because it we may have to make commit two or more times"
        # This implies they WANT it to be correct on the first try OR they want to manually fix?
        # Actually, "instead of fixing" usually means they don't want the hook to change the file.
        # Let's switch `ruff-format` to check only if possible, or explain.
        # Actually, `ruff-format` hook overwrites.
        # To check only:
        args: [--check]
